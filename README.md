# OutputTest
MicroPython Tester for Ian Hart's Pico02 / Pico03 Raspberry Pi Pico based CBUS Board (16 outputs) for MERG CBUS

This tester makes each output active for 0.5 second in turn, with the other outputs off

It performs ten loops before returning control to the Python interpreter (easily modifiable to be indefinite)

Note that this program does not use or test the CBUS interface itself.
